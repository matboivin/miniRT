# Object intersections

[Primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_primitive) are simple geometric shapes such as a cube, cylinder, sphere, ...  
A [quadric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric) is a surface in a (D + 1)-dimensional space.

> The class of quadrics (surfaces that can be defined by a quadratic equation) include cylinders, cones, ellipsoids, paraboloids, etc. Note that spheres and planes are a special subclass but have faster routines as special cases. For these we will use the parametric ray formulation and the implicit surface equation for the quadratics.  
The general quadric surface equation is  
`F(x, y, z) = Ax2 + By2 + Cz2 + Dxy+ Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0`

Formula to compute the intersection point:

```
intersection point = ray origin + t * ray direction
```

When solving quadratic equation:

`A t^2 + B t + C = 0`

-> Discriminant: `d = sqrt(B^2 - 4 AC)`

```
b^2 - (4 * a * c)
```

- discriminant < 0 : there is no intersection
- discriminant == 0 : only one intersection
- discriminant > 0 : two intersections

A sphere embedded in a 3D space:

```
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1

// Xc, Yc, Zc : sphere center
// Solving quadratic equation

a = ray dir.x^2 + ray dir.y^2 + ray dir.z^2
b = 2 * (ray dir.x * (ray origin.x - Xc) + ray dir.y * (ray origin.y - Yc) + ray dir.z * (ray origin.z - Zc))
c = ((ray origin.x - Xc)^2 + (ray origin.y - Yc)^2 + (ray origin.z - Zc)^2) - r^2

root1 = (-b + sqrt(det)) / (2 * a);
root2 = (-b - sqrt(det)) / (2 * a);

```
### Local Space

A function that generates the radius 1 sphere would be: `f(x,y,z)=x2+y2+z2âˆ’1`

`r` is the radius of the sphere:

```
   c1  c2  c3  c4

x [ r,  0,  0, T1]
y [ 0,  r,  0, T2]
z [ 0,  0,  r, T3]
w [ 0,  0,  0,  1]
```

## Plane

```
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0; 

// (A, B, C) : plane normal

t = - ((A*X + B*Y + C*Z + D) / (A*DIR.x + B*DIR.y + C*DIR.z))
// (X Y Z) = (O.x-pointplaneX O.y-pointplaneY O.z-pointplane.Z)
```

1. Intersect with plane
2. Use side / vertices / radius to check if point is inside shape

### World Space

#### Infinite cylinder

```
x^2 + y^2 - r^2 = 0

// Solving quadratic equation

tmp_a = ray dir - dot(ray dir, cyl dir) * cyl dir
delta = ray pos - cyl base
tmp_b = delta - dot(delta, cyl dir) * cyl dir

a = tmp_a^2
b = 2 * dot(tmp_a, tmp_b))
c = tmp_b^2 - r^2
```

#### Finite cylinder

Check if point is between zmin and zmax (or ymin and ymax).

### Local Space

#### Infinite cylinder

Same process than a sphere but set the z axis (or y according to your coordinates system) to null.

`r` is the radius of the cylinder and `h` is the height of the cylinder:

```
   c1  c2  c3  c4

x [ r,  0,  0, T1]
y [ 0,  h,  0, T2]
z [ 0,  0,  r, T3]
w [ 0,  0,  0,  1]
```

#### Finite cylinder

Use the normal to compute intersection angle with cylinder.

```
dot(ray dir, normal) > 0
```
